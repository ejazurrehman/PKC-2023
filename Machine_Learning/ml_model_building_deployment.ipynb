    "1. Simple Imputation Technique:\n",
    "   - This technique involves replacing missing values with a simple imputation value. For example, if a value is missing, it can be  replaced with the mean or median or mode of the respective feature. This technique is simple to implement but may not be effective for all types of data. \n",
    "2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation:\n",
    "   - This technique involves finding the K-nearest neighbors to the data point with missing values and then imputing the missing values based on the values of these neighbors. This technique is more effective than simple imputation but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "3. Regression Imputation:\n",
    "   - This technique involves using a regression model to predict the missing values. This technique is more effective than simple imputation but requires a good understanding of the relationships between the features. \n",
    "4. Decision Tree Imputation:\n",
    "   - This technique involves using a decision tree to predict the missing values. This technique is more effective than simple imputation but can be computationally expensive for large datasets. \n",
    "5. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE):\n",
    "   - This technique involves using a series of regression models to impute the missing values. This technique is more effective than simple imputation but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "6. Deep Learning Imputation:\n",
    "   - This technique involves using deep learning models such as neural networks to impute the missing values. This technique is more effective than simple imputation but requires a good understanding of deep learning concepts.\n",
    "7. Time Series Effective Method:\n",
