# logical operators are " true or false" or "yes or no" or "0 or 1"
# in python, we use the following symbols to represent these operators

# equal to          ==
# not equal to      !=
# greater than      >
# less than         <
# greater than or equal to  >=
# less than or equal to  <=

# print (5 == 5)  # prints: True
# print (5 != 5)  # prints: False
# print (5 > 5)   # prints: False
# print (5 < 5)   # prints: False
# print (5 >= 5)  # prints: True
# print (5 <= 5)  # prints: True
