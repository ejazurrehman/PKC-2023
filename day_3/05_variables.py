# variable is used to combine the data set in a single manner
# we can use the variable to store the data in a single variable
# we can easly recall the data using the variable
# it reduces the human effort during programming
# it makes the code more readable and understandable
# it reduces the code length
# it makes the code more efficient
# it reduces the code complexity
# it makes the code more scalable
# it makes the code more maintainable
# it makes the code more flexible
# it makes the code more reusable
# it makes the code more reliable
# it makes the code more robust
# it makes the code more secure
# it makes the code more efficient

# vriable name should other than python kewords

# variable name should be easy to recall
# variable name should be easy to remember
# variable name should be easy to spell
# variable name should be easy to pronounce
# variable name should be easy to read
# variable name should be easy to write
# variable name should be easy to type
# variable name should be easy to copy

# class, tuple, when we assigned more than one string in variable is called tuple
# to find out the type of the assigned variable

# print(type(a))
# print(type(x))

# print(type(name_2))
# class, string

y = "18"

# this is type casting, we can change the type of the variable at any time

# y = 18.7
# print(type(y))

# y = int(y)
# print(type(y))
# print(y)
# In this example, we are converting a float number to an integer.
