    "Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that allows us to make predictions, generalizations, or conclusions about a larger population based on a sample of data. It goes beyond merely describing data (as in descriptive statistics) and helps in making evidence-based decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Uses a Sample to Draw Conclusions About a Population\n",
    "\n",
    "Since collecting data from an entire population is often impractical, inferential statistics helps estimate population parameters using sample data.\n",
    "Involves Probability Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses probability to determine how likely it is that findings from the sample apply to the population.\n",
    "Includes Hypothesis Testing and Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests assumptions about population characteristics.\n",
    "Types of Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "1. Estimation (Confidence Intervals)\n",
    "Used to estimate population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion) based on sample data.\n",
    "Example: If the average height of 100 students is 170 cm, we might estimate that the height of all students in the school falls between 168 cm and 172 cm (with a 95% confidence level).\n",
    "2. Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Used to test assumptions or claims about a population.\n",
    "Example: A company claims that its new diet plan helps in weight loss. Hypothesis testing determines if sample data supports this claim.\n",
    "Common hypothesis tests include:\n",
    "\n",
    "t-Test (Compares means of two groups)\n",
    "Chi-Square Test (Checks relationships between categorical variables)\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) (Compares means of multiple groups)\n",
    "3. Regression Analysis\n",
    "Examines relationships between variables and makes predictions.\n",
    "Example: Predicting sales based on advertising budget.\n",
    "4. Correlation Analysis\n",
    "Measures the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.\n",
    "Example: Checking if studying hours and exam scores are positively related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "A researcher surveys 500 students in a university about their study habits. Instead of surveying all 20,000 students, inferential statistics allows the researcher to generalize results to the entire student population using confidence intervals and hypothesis testing."
