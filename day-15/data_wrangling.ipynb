    "Data Wrangling (also known as Data Munging) is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a structured and usable format for analysis. It involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and converting data into a format suitable for data analytics or machine learning."

    "3. Data Transformation – Converting data types, normalizing, aggregating, and restructuring data.\n",
    "4. Data Enrichment – Combining multiple datasets to enhance data quality.\n",
    "5. Data Validation – Ensuring the data is accurate, complete, and formatted correctly.\n",
